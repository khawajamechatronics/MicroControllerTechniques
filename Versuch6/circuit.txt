Circuit
=======

The relay switches between input- and output-mode.
With this we can staticly initialize our ports which removes the runtime
overhead of mode switching (10 instructions -> 1 instruction).
Additionally to this we use an external low pass filter, a buffer
and a comparator which benefits the processing since we directly get a clean
digital signal from our comparator.
The reference level to trigger an interrupt can be set via P1.
Since we can now route the input of the comparator to an interrupt enabled pin
we can save processing time since we can use interrupts instead of polling.
